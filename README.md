# Slack-bot-File-Uploading üìÅ

Slack-Bot is a communication tool used by developers and companies to share information and communicate. It has grown very popular in recent years.

In this Golang project, we‚Äôre building a slack bot that uploads a file.
With so much technology available to individuals and corporations , you could have several different files uploaded to your stack server. Slack supports several file
types including standard images . Users can also ink videos that can be viewed directly from the link displaying the video content and play buttons in slack.
